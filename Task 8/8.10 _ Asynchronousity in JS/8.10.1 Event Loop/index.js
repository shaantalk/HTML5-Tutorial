// What is JS ?
// JS is a single-threaded, non-blocking, asynchronous, concurrent language.
// JS have a call stack, event loop, a callback queue, some other API and stuff

// So, does V8 (Chrome's JS Runtime) have the same things ?
// No, V8 has call stack and a heap

// Heap : Where the memory allocation happens
// Call Stack : stack data structure that stores information about the active subroutines of a computer program. pop one function/line of code and executes it

// Things that are not part of JS and are provided by Browser. ( Show Image 1 )
// 1 : WebAPIs like XMLHTTPRequest, setTimeOut etc
// 2 : Event Loop
// 3 : Callback Queue
